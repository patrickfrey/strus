strus (0.5.1)
  * Small fixes for bringing up packages again
 -- Patrick Frey <patrickpfrey@yahoo.com>  Mon, 7 Mar 2016 18:00:00 +0100

strus (0.5.0)
  * add upperbound seek with upper key restriction to database interface (not used yet in storage)
  * change return value of document term iterator skipDoc from boolean to document number
  * more helpers for posting iterator implementations (just a start) and reorganize code in posting join operator iterators (eliminate copy paste code)
  * changed logarithm base in weighting from e to 10, fixed summarizer metadata
  * fixed metadata summarizer: could not extract first metadata element
  * rewrote posting set join of the 'contains', 'sequence' and 'within' operators

  * changed query interface: result is now a structure containing also some statistical information like the number of matching documents and not only a vector of ranks
  * use unordered_map instead of compact node trie for keymaps. They are about 30% slower, but the problem with memory limits and an overflow map, that eats up any performance gain, does not appear (much better)
  * do not read keymaps during insertion (performance gain in bulk insert of factors)
  * added new weighting function BM25pff (BM25 with proximity based ff)
