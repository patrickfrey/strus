		<h2>About</h2>
		<p class="description">The open source project <i>Strus</i> provides a collection 
		libraries and command line tools written in C++ for building a competitive, 
		scalable full-text search engine.<br/>
		The <i>Strus</i> search engine can be built using any key value store database that provides an
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_and_lower_bounds">upper bound</a> seek function
		for the stored key/value pairs. Currently, there exists an implementation based on the 
		<a href="http://leveldb.org">LevelDB</a> library.<br/>
		</p>
		<h2>Demo system</h2>
		<p class="description">There is a demo system online for <i>Strus</i>:
		<br/>A <a href="http://demo.project-strus.net/strus.html">search</a> on the complete Wikipedia collection (English)
		with a <a href="wikipediaSearchNuc.htm">description</a> how the system can be installed and the index built.
		</p>

		<h2>Tutorials</h2>
		<p class="description">
		A tutorial for building a simple search engine with <i>PHP</i> is available <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1009582/Building-a-search-engine-with-Strus-tutorial">here</a>.
		<br/> Another tutorial for building a nontrivial search engine also covering the insert case with <i>Python</i> and the <i>Tornado web framework</i> is available <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1059766/Building-a-search-engine-with-Python-Tornado-and-S">here</a>.
		<br/> An introduction that shows how to write dynamically loadable extensions of the <i>Strus</i> core
		in C++ can be found <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1072683/How-to-extend-a-Strus-search-engine-with-new-funct">here</a>.
		<br/> An article that shows how scalable search engines can be built with <i>Strus</i> (distributing the search index) can be found <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1066960/Distributing-a-search-engine-index-with-Strus">here</a>.
		</p>

		<h2>Installation</h2>
		<p class="description">
		For installation see description files <b>INSTALL.&lt;platform.&gt;</b> in the top level directory of each project.
		The descriptions of the project installations are intended to be self contained.
		For example for <i>Ubuntu</i>: <a href="https://github.com/patrickfrey/strusBase/blob/master/INSTALL.Ubuntu.md">strusBase</a>,
		<a href="https://github.com/patrickfrey/strus/blob/master/INSTALL.Ubuntu.md">strus</a>,
		<a href="https://github.com/patrickfrey/strusAnalyzer/blob/master/INSTALL.Ubuntu.md">strusAnalyzer</a>,
		<a href="https://github.com/patrickfrey/strusTrace/blob/master/INSTALL.Ubuntu.md">strusTrace</a>,
		<a href="https://github.com/patrickfrey/strusModule/blob/master/INSTALL.Ubuntu.md">strusModule</a>,
		<a href="https://github.com/patrickfrey/strusRpc/blob/master/INSTALL.Ubuntu.md">strusRpc</a>,
		<a href="https://github.com/patrickfrey/strusVector/blob/master/INSTALL.Ubuntu.md">strusVector</a>,
		<a href="https://github.com/patrickfrey/strusPattern/blob/master/INSTALL.Ubuntu.md">strusPattern</a>,

		<a href="https://github.com/patrickfrey/strusBindings/blob/master/INSTALL.Ubuntu.md">strusBindings</a>
		and <a href="https://github.com/patrickfrey/strusAll/blob/master/INSTALL.Ubuntu.md">strusAll</a>.
		</p>

		<h2>Regular Builds</h2>
		<p class="description">
		The software is built regurarly on <a href="https://travis-ci.org/patrickfrey">Travis</a> (on commit of the master branch)
		and on <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/monitor/home:PatrickFrey">the OpenSUSE build cluster</a> (currently triggered manually).
		</p>

		<h2>Documentation</h2>
		<p class="description">The documentation is work in progress.
		What is available can be found <a href="documentation.htm">here</a>.
		</p>
		<h3>The inverted case of pattern matching</h3>
		<p class="description">
		The documentation for doing high performance pattern matching with many thousands of patterns 
		can be found <a href="introduction_struspattern.htm">here</a>.
		It allows you to define tokens with regular expressions in text and to define patterns with these tokens as alphabet.
		With the help of <a href="https://01.org/hyperscan">Hyperscan</a> that builds one DFA for all regular expressions 
		<i>StrusPattern</i> gets a competitive performance.
		Approximative matching on Unicode strings with edit distance is also supported.
		</p>

		<h2>Story</h2>
		<p class="description">Why build yet another search engine? <a href="story.htm">Here</a>
		I tell about my motivation and the story of <i>Strus</i>. I also try to explain,
		what distinguishes <i>Strus</i> from other search engine software.
